        <h2>Service Business</h2>
        <p>
          Lets start with Service businesses and what the future, with NutraBiz
          LLC as your partner, will look like. First, Service businesses are
          very labor intensive and takes a toll on every part of your life. If
          you are a Salon Owner or Chiropractor you are paid for your labor. If
          you are sick and cant work you dont get paid unless you have
          associates working under you that you supervise, and they probably
          cant pay your overhead without you being there. Did you find that to
          be true during the pandemic? You have job security because services
          can not be done on the internet so you will always have foot traffic
          in your front door. Now, here is the shift! What if there was a way
          for you to grow your foot traffic, build goodwill in the community by
          providing a new service, and potentially double your bottom line
          profits with a self funding addition. That will not only pay for
          itself quickly but provide you with added revenue for years to come?
          Your business can become a Stay N Shape Weight Loss Center and
          re-cashflow your foot traffic! Think about the possibilities when
          everybody is getting energy, losing pounds and inches, feeling
          motivated with great mental clarity and they have to come into YOUR
          Business to get it. Think about the referrals you will get from
          existing foot traffic. When those referrals are in your business
          purchasing products they will book additional services also. We want
          to make it easier. For every bottle you purchase we give you 2 free
          sample packs and 2 free brochures to assure you sell your bottles
          quickly, all while doubling your money over and over. Gyms owners can
          benefit the exact same way as both a Service business and a Retail
          business! Stay N Shape is a testimony rich product with over 30
          Million capsules of the formula already sold worldwide. This product
          combined with our niche marketing system is a no-brainer for the
          Service business industry. Plus you can not fail. Any unsold product
          you may have after 6 months of your initial order we will gladly take
          back and pay you 100% of what you paid for the unopened product. We
          exist to bless your business.

        <h2>Retail Business</h2>
        <p>
          For our Retail business friends. As you know, the internet has really
          hurt the Retail business, as well as, the Mom and Pop brick and mortar
          stores. If your Retail business is a Health Food Store, Herb Shop,
          Gym, Fitness Center or Drug Store, the supplements you carry can most
          likely be bought cheaper on the internet than from your business.
          Those brand names your business carries are widely available across
          the internet at discount prices. So, how can we help your business?
          Enter to become a Stay N Shape Weight Loss Center. GNC, Whole Foods,
          Vitamin World, CVS and Walgreens are not Stay N Shape Weight Loss
          Centers. As a matter of fact, they are not weight loss centers at all.
          There is your New claim to fame. You are now a Stay N Shape Weight
          Loss Center and can advertise your Retail business as such. There is a
          New Buzz in the community about your business! And, we dont compete
          with your business by selling products, at the same price or cheaper,
          on the internet. Customers and their referrals have to physically walk
          into your business to get it for cheaper. And we know 90% of the time
          they will grab other products while there. We provide all businesses
          with window signs and also have Stay N Shape Weight Loss Center
          banners available as well. We also make it easier. We give you 2
          sample packs and 2 brochures for every bottle purchased. You can also
          offer your customers a guarantee which will make Stay N Shape stand
          out above those Name Brands. If a customer brings a bottle back saying
          it didnt work, simply refund their money and send us the bottle with a
          copy of their drivers license. We will replace the bottle, no
          questions asked. As you can see, we know Retail. Become a Stay N Shape
          Weight Loss Center today and outsmart the competition!
